#FAP-Luggage-Activation-Pkg

This is a Makefile for [The Luggage](https://github.com/unixorn/luggage) that packages the Activation and Registration files from FontAgent Pro 6.

This is intended to be used with a Volume License key.

Simply copy your Acrivation and Registration files into the same directory as the Makefile and edit the TITLE and REVERSE_DOMAIN at the top of the Makefile. Then run 'make pkg'.
